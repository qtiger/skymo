<p>A page generally needs at least either content, a template or a script, but it may have any or all of these. For example a simple page may simply have content and slot directly into the site's master template. A more complex page may have a template and either content or sections (for example a list of news items)</p>
<p>A script may be used in conjunction with a template and/or content to implement more advanced behaviour.</p>
<h2>Admin Interface</h2>
<p>The admin interface currently allows access to some editing functionality for the site. This includes editing most of the page details above, and a markdown editor for the content files.</p>
<p>As of the current version, the following features are not yet implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to add new page</li>
<li>Ability to change the order of site items </li>
<li>Template editor </li>
<li>Script editor </li>
<li>Menu editor</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions can still be achieved by using a file editor on the appropriate site files </p>
<h2>User Level</h2>
<p>Accessed to the site is determined by user levels. There are six defined user levels, but if required it is possible to add more.</p>
